Glorp is a cross-platform gaming library layered on top of Glop. It provides Lua support and a maturing set of UI primitives and shortcuts. It is designed to build a full game installer in a single command for any of its supported target platforms (Windows, OSX 10.5, and Linux.) I make no attempt to preserve backwards compatibility with it - if you intend to write software on it, I strongly recommend forking whatever version you intend to use and sticking with it, as future versions may break interfaces unpredictably.

In order to use it, first create a directory for your new project. Copy the glorp/template contents to that directory, then check out glorp as a subdirectory, such that you have yourproject/glorp. Initialize the submodule inside it containing Glop. Follow the requirements for building Glop (you don't actually need to do the "./Den glop" step, Glorp will take care of that, but it won't hurt anything.) Go to your project and edit the Den file in a text editor for configuration. A font is mandatory. "./Den" will build, "./Den run" will run it skipping the intro screen and with some debugging data, "./Den package" will generate a package.

Note that there's a lot of Mandible Games-specific stuff in the repo. You'll need to get rid of that before releasing anything. This isn't as easy as it could be. Sorry! If there's interest, I can try to make it easier.

I recommend grabbing the "data" directory out of whatever my most recent game is, then plugging it in to your project, just to see how things work. Note that my games are *not* open-source, only this library is, but the lua code is certainly readable.
