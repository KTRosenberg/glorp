This release includes many free or open-source packages, all of which I am truly thankful for.

libogg and libvorbis are included under the terms of their respective licenses. The enormous text of those licenses are below.

zlib and libpng are included. Thankfully, their license does not require me to bloat this file even further.

libfreetype is included under the terms of its license, which allows me to merely include the following line:
Portions of this software are copyright © 2009 The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.

fmod is included under the terms of its license, which (I think) allows me to merely include the following line:
FMOD Sound System, copyright © Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2009.

I rely very heavily on Lua 5.1. I am actually not sure if its license requires that I reproduce it here. I shall do so anyway. It is below. I also rely on Luabind, whose near-identical license is also below, and Luajit, which, well, you can see where this is going.

I'm leaning on GLee because Windows is terrible. Yep you heard me. Windows is terrible. Its license, natch, is below.

(GLee's, not Windows's.)

On OSX I'm using Chris Campbell's elegant little version loader to give reasonable version errors. You can probably guess where its license is. Technically I could remove this bit for the Windows build, but :effort:

I'm using curl for the error reporting system. You know the drill by now.

My standard error reporter is based in part on the work of the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org). That line is all they require me to say. Thanks, FLTK! Thltk.

This may or may not include box2d. If it does, license below. If it doesn't, license below anyway.

This relies on several of my own libraries, including lgl, glorp, and glop. It was built using ursa. All of these are available using extremely permissive licenses, either BSD or the standard Lua license. Check them out at http://github.com/zorbathut .
